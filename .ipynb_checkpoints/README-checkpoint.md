# python-portfolio

This repo is intended to store all my IPython Notebooks. Most projects here are also hosted on my personal blog/ portfolio at https://adityakamath.com where you can read my writeup explaining the code and follow along by downloading the .ipynb file. Project topics include Machine Learning, Optimization, Web Scraping and Visualization. The project descriptions are provided below.

## I Love Pandas 

In this post, I explore the basic use of the Pandas libaray in Python and how you can use it to manipulate                     datasets and create quick visualizations.

## Interactive Plotting in Bokeh

I recreate the popular Gapminder World data visualization using Bokeh's Python library for                                     interactive plotting.

## Crypotcurrency Data and Plotly

I explore another intractive plotting Library in Python called Plotly. I write a script that downloads updated coin prices and plots them.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

My rendition of the Dijkstra's Algorithm scripted in Python.

## Discrete Optimization in PuLP

I model and solve a multi-period manufacturing scheduling problem using a Python library called PuLP for linear programming. I then visualize the results using the Seaborn library.

## Clustering Algorithms in Scikit Learn

In this post, I apply Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering algorithms in order to explore the possibility of creating better product families from a dataset that contains product demand data.
