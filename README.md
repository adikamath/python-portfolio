All projects here include code, visualization and write-ups from personal analytics projects that I ran mainly using Python. Topics include Machine Learning, Optimization and Visualization.

Projects (from oldest to latest): 

1. I Love Pandas: In this post, I explore the basic use of the Pandas libaray in Python and how you can use it to manipulate                     datasets and create quick visualizations.

2. Interactive Plotting in Bokeh: I recreate the popular Gapminder World data visualization using Bokeh's Python library for                                     interactive plotting.

3. Crypotcurrency Data and Plotly: I explore another intractive plotting Library in Python called Plotly. I write a script                                        that downloads updated coin prices and plots them.

4. Dijkstra's Algorithm: My rendition of the Dijkstra's Algorithm scripted in Python.

5. Discrete Optimization in PuLP: I model and solve a multi-period manufacturing scheduling problem using a Python library                                       called PuLP for linear programming. I then visualize the results using the Seaborn library.

6. Clustering Algorithms in Scikit Learn: In this post, I apply Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering algorithms in                                             order to explore the possibility of creating better product families from a dataset                                           that contains product demand data.
